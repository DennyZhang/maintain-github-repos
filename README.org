This gives people more confidence that your repos are active. See [[https://github.com/DennyZhang/maintain-github-repos/issues][sample]].

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
先说说与技能无关的收获吧，毕业设计做的是一个《最小物联网系统》，考虑到我们专业老师没有这方面知识，答辩时会带来问题，尽量往这方面靠拢。当我毕业后，这个项目已经有过百个star了，这样易上手的东西还是比较受欢迎的(ps: 不过这种硬件相关的项目通常受限于Github上硬件开发工程师比较少的困扰)。

毕业后一个月收到PACKT出版社的邮件(ps: 他们是在github上找到我的)，内容是关于Review一本物联网书籍，即在《从Review到翻译IT书籍》中提到的《Learning Internet of Things》。作为一个四级没过的"物联网专家"，去审阅一本英文的物联网书籍。。。当然，后来是审阅完了，书上有我的英文简介。

一个月前，收到MANNING出版社的邮件(ps: 也是在github上)，关于Review一本物联网书籍的目录，并提出建议。

也因此带来了其他更多的东西，当然不是这里的主题。在这里，我们就不讨论各种骚扰邮件，或者中文合作。从没有想象过，我也可以在英语世界有一片小天地。

这些告诉我们，Github上找一个你擅长的主题，那么会有很多人找上你的。
